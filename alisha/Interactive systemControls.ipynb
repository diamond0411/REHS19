The terminal applications are used to connect clients (you and your laptop) to remote computers (such as Comet). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell for more information. The best known example of using a terminal is for logging in/connecting to a remote computer systems by users. This is called a client-server connection. Terminals are interactive: you type in a command to run, and the outputs are displayed on the terminal. Executing any command is done by typing it and pressing Enter.\n",
